# PracticeProject-FFMPEGVideoStreaming

University Practice at Starnet - a network provider company or something.

**Mentor:** Oleg Burlacu

I had the opportunity to implement a system for video streaming, very similar to how Starnet streams Television to its clients or how YouTube does streaming.

A very fun project
